## 🧵 JVM Concurrency – Detailed Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, learners will be able to:

1. **Explain core execution concepts**  
   Clearly differentiate between:
   - **Process** – an independent program with its own memory.
   - **Thread** – a lightweight execution unit inside a process.
   - **Task** – a logical unit of work scheduled on a thread.  
   Learners will understand why multi-threading is used and where it is appropriate.

2. **Implement parallel execution**  
   Use Java's threading APIs to run code concurrently:
   - Creating threads using the `Thread` class
   - Using `Runnable` for lightweight jobs
   - Using `Callable` + `Future` to return results from tasks

3. **Coordinate threads safely**  
   Prevent race conditions using:
   - `synchronized` methods/blocks  
   - Reentrant locks (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`)  
   - Concurrent collections such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `BlockingQueue`

4. **Manage concurrency using the Executor Framework**  
   Use:
   - `ExecutorService`  
   - Fixed, cached, and scheduled thread pools  
   Learners will understand queueing, task submission, and graceful shutdown.

5. **Use the Stream API and functional constructs**  
   Apply:
   - Lambdas
   - Functional interfaces (`Function`, `Predicate`, `Supplier`, etc.)
   - Parallel streams (and when to avoid them)

6. **Write safe, deadlock-free code**  
   Understand:
   - The causes of race conditions
   - Deadlock scenarios (circular wait)
   - Techniques to avoid deadlocks (ordering locks, using timeouts, minimizing shared state)

7. **Benchmark and profile concurrent programs**  
   Use tools and techniques to:
   - Measure performance
   - Compare single-threaded vs multi-threaded execution
   - Interpret CPU utilisation, thread dumps, and contention hotspots

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Detailed Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

1. **Analyse time and space complexity deeply**  
   Explain:
   - Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega
   - Why some structures are faster for reads/writes/searches  
   Compare complexity trade-offs between arrays, lists, trees, stacks, queues, and hashes.

2. **Implement foundational data structures from scratch in Java**  
   Build internal understanding by coding:
   - **Arrays** (dynamic resizing, traversal, searching)
   - **Stacks** (push/pop, call-stack simulation)
   - **Queues** (circular queues, priority queues conceptually)
   - **Linked Lists** (single, double, operations at head/middle/tail)
   - **Hash Maps** (hash functions, collision resolution with chaining/open addressing)

3. **Use recursion and iteration effectively**  
   Understand:
   - Base conditions, recursion depth, stack overflow scenarios
   - Converting recursive algorithms into iterative versions
   - Templates like DFS, backtracking, divide-and-conquer

4. **Evaluate algorithm efficiency using Big-O notation**  
   Learners will measure and explain the cost of:
   - Searching  
   - Sorting  
   - Traversing structures  
   - Adding/removing elements  
   And justify why certain approaches scale better with input size.

5. **Apply problem-solving heuristics**  
   Use systematic thinking tools:
   - **Decomposition** – breaking problems into smaller tasks  
   - **Pattern Recognition** – identifying reusable algorithmic shapes  
   - **Iteration Refinement** – improving a naive solution step-by-step  
   - **Analogy** – using known solutions to approach new problems  

6. **Write clean, production-quality solutions**  
   Demonstrate:
   - Proper naming, modularity, and comments  
   - Writing unit tests  
   - Submitting well-organised GitHub repositories  
   - Using Java best practices for clarity and maintainability

7. **Solve real-world algorithmic problems**  
   Apply algorithms to practical cases:
   - Scheduling  
   - Searching and indexing  
   - Memory-efficient data handling  
   - Optimisation problems  
   Learners will be able to defend their solution choices based on complexity and readability.
